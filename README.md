This repository contains all the assignments done as part of CSE527 - Computer Vision class done under Professor Roy Shilkrot. Below is the summary of tasks in each assignment.

## 0. Hello Vision
Write an OpenCV program to do the following things:
* Read an image from a file and display it to the screen
* Add to, subtract from, multiply or divide each pixel with a scalar, display the result.
* Resize the image uniformly by Â½
  
## 1. Histograms, Filters, Deconvolution, Blending
* Perform Histogram Equalization on the given input image.
* Perform Low-Pass, High-Pass and Deconvolution on the given input image.
* Perform Laplacian Blending on the two input images (blend them together).

## 2. Image Alignment, Panoramas
Your goal is to create 2 panoramas:
* Using homographies and perspective warping on a common plane (3 images).
* Using cylindrical warping (many images).
