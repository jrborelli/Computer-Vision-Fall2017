# Notes on Multi-View Geometry, Stereo, Structured Light, SFM, MVS, Visual Odometry

## 1. Multi-View Geometry
* PROBLEMS
  * Finding 3D points of objects
  * Find position of camera
     * relative to world origin
     * motion between cameras
 * Focal Length
    * Small => wider field of view
    * Large => narrower field of view
    * tan(theta/2) = W/2f, W = sensor size
    * (cx, cy) = (W/2, H/2)
